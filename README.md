# Inelestic-Magnetic-Tunneling-Junction


## Abstract : We model the magnetic tunneling junction based on Fe/MgO/Fe structure for inelastic and elastic quantum transport problems. We observe that the optical phonon effect is more participated in the high bias condition ( see Fig. 1), which is consistent with the paper [91]. In addition, We also observe that the elecrons relax energy from the source to the drain transport due to the inelastic optical phonon effect  (see Fig.2).






## Numerical Method : 

Use the algorithm proposed by Supriyo Datta paper (quantum transport simulation pioneer group).

Fig 1. The current voltage characteristic curves for different scattering strengths. The result is similar to the paper [91] which shows that the current versus voltage curves are insensitive to the optical phonon under the low applied external voltages.

Fig 2. Left: Energy position resolved energy/current profile for ballistic and inelastic transport in Fe/MgO/Fe structures for parallel configuration. Right : current versus energy curves for corresponding cases at the contact 1, contact 2 and scattering contact. The electron energy relaxation via the optical phonon can be clearly seen at the contact 1 and contact 2 edges for inelastic transport. In addition, the current magnitude is also depressed by the optical phonon as shown in the right graphs.
