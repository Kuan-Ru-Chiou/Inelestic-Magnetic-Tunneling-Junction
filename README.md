# Inelestic-Magnetic-Tunneling-Junction


## Abstract : We model the magnetic tunneling junction based on Fe/MgO/Fe structure for inelastic and elastic quantum transport problems. We observe that the optical phonon effect is more participated in the high bias condition ( see current v.s. voltage curve), which is consistent with the paper []. In addition, We also observe that the elecrons relax energy from the source to the drain transport due to the inelastic optical phonon effect  (see Fig.2).






## Numerical Method : 

Use the algorithm proposed by Supriyo Datta (quantum transport simulation pioneer group).
